## Features

### Implemented Trading Logic

✅ **Polymarket Trading Logic** - Full implementation of Polymarket's blockchain-based trading system

- Polygon network integration with ethers-rs
- USDC balance management
- Conditional token contract interactions
- Order placement and execution

✅ **Cross-Platform Arbitrage** - Advanced event matching and price discrepancy detection

- Intelligent event matching using similarity algorithms
- Real-time price monitoring across platforms
- Simultaneous trade execution between Polymarket (Polygon) and Kalshi

✅ **Gabagool Strategy** - Single-platform hedged arbitrage on Polymarket

- Detects YES/NO price imbalances on Polymarket
- Locks in profit by buying both sides when combined cost < $1.00
- Runs simultaneously with cross-platform arbitrage

✅ **Position Management** - Comprehensive tracking and settlement system

- Real-time position monitoring
- Automatic settlement checking
- Profit/loss calculation

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - This bot is actively being developed and improved. Features may be incomplete or change.

## Setup

> **Note**: This setup is for development/testing only. Ensure you understand the code before running with real funds.

1. **Install Rust**:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Configure `.env`** (create from `.env.example`):
   - **Polymarket:** `POLYGON_RPC_URL`, `POLYMARKET_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - **Kalshi:** `KALSHI_API_ID`, `KALSHI_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - **15m crypto (optional):** `POLYMARKET_USE_GAMMA=1`, `POLYMARKET_TAG_SLUG=crypto`, `KALSHI_SERIES_TICKER`, `COIN_FILTER=btc|eth|sol`

3. **Build & Run** (for testing/development):
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Platforms

| Platform   | Type           | Access Method                    | Currency | Supported |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Polymarket | Decentralized  | Polygon (on-chain)               | USDC     | ✅ Full   |
| Kalshi     | CFTC-regulated | On-chain (Solana, data 100+ chains) + REST API | USD      | ✅ Full   |

**Note**:

- **Polymarket**: This bot interacts via **Polygon** (on-chain trading with USDC).
- **Kalshi**: Kalshi is on-chain (tokenized event contracts on **Solana**, real-time data via Pyth on 100+ chains). This bot uses **Kalshi’s REST API** only (`trading-api.kalshi.com`) for trading, not their Solana/on-chain layer.
- Cross-platform arbitrage is performed between these two platforms only.

## Trading Strategies

1. **Cross-Platform Arbitrage** (Polymarket ↔ Kalshi)
   - Matches identical events across platforms
   - Detects price discrepancies
   - Executes simultaneous trades to lock in profit

2. **Gabagool Strategy** (Polymarket only)
   - Single-platform hedged arbitrage
   - Buys both YES and NO when combined cost < $1.00
   - Guarantees profit regardless of outcome

Both strategies run **simultaneously** in parallel for maximum opportunity detection.

## Technical Highlights

- **Rust Performance** - Zero-cost abstractions and async/await for maximum efficiency
- **Modular Design** - Clean separation of concerns, easy to extend
- **Error Handling** - Robust error management with proper propagation
- **Concurrent Execution** - Parallel strategy execution using tokio
- **Type Safety** - Strong typing throughout for reliability
- **Dual Strategy Monitoring** - Simultaneous cross-platform and single-platform arbitrage
